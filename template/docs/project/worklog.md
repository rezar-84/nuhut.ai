# Worklog — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

> Append-only. **Newest entry at the top.** One entry per completed work item, written
> at the LOG step of the loop, using `../templates/worklog-entry.md`.
>
> This is where a future reader — human or agent — learns *why* the system looks the way
> it does, what was actually verified, and what is still wrong. The backlog says what;
> this says why, and what it cost.

**Rules**

- Every entry names its `{{PREFIX}}-###`.
- **Never rewrite history.** If an entry was wrong, append a correction that references
  it. The record of a mistaken belief is part of the record.
- The **Not done** section is mandatory. Deferred, stubbed, mocked, and hardcoded things
  are listed with follow-up IDs. An entry with no "Not done" section is either
  exceptional or incomplete, and it is usually the second.
- Verification is reported with real commands and real results. "Tests pass" is not a
  verification record.
- When this file gets long, move older entries to `worklog-archive/YYYY.md` and leave a
  pointer here. Do not truncate.
